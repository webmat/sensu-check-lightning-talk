## Lightning talk about creating a Sensu check

The outline I used to prepare this presentation is in
[outline.md](https://github.com/webmat/sensu-check-lightning-talk/blob/master/outline.md).
It's outdated, though.
You should instead look at the presentation
[on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/webmat/creating-a-sensu-check) or
at the examples in this repo's `checks` directory.

This talk was delivered [on November 4th](http://www.devopsmtl.com/2013/10/21/november-4th-meetup-monitoring-and-graphing/).
